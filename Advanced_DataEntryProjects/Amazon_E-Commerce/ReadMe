This project simulates an end-to-end e-commerce analytics workflow using anonymized Amazon Fashion sales data from 2022. 
Built in Excel with over 128,000 transaction records, it demonstrates how data cleaning, transformation, and visualization 
can turn raw data into business-ready insights.

The analysis explores monthly sales trends, category performance, cancellation rates, and top-performing cities, presented through dynamic dashboards 
powered by PivotTables and charts. It highlights strong seasonal sales patterns, dominant city markets such as Bengaluru and Mumbai, and variations 
in cancellation behavior across the year.
