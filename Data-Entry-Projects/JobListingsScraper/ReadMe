This project demonstrates how Power Query can be used within Excel to extract, clean, and visualize real web data. 
I connected directly to the RemoteOK job board using Excel’s From Web feature, transforming raw HTML tables into a structured dataset of 25 job listings.

All steps — from scraping to cleaning — were completed entirely in Excel without external tools. 
The final dashboard highlights salary variations, job title distributions, and key web data transformation techniques.
