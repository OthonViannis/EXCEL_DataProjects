This project demonstrates how Excel can be used to streamline manual data entry and enhance data quality. 
I created a built-in Data Entry Form to record executive contact details efficiently, reducing typing errors and ensuring clean, consistent data.

The dataset, generated with Mockaroo, was manually entered and analyzed using PivotTables, lookup formulas, and Slicers to simulate a real-world business scenario. 
The final dashboard provides a clear summary of company, location, and industry insights, showcasing both data entry and basic analytical skills.
